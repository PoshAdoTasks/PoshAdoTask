## [[1.0.0]](https://github.com/PoshAdoTasks/PoshAdoTask/releases/tag/v1.0.0) - 2023-01-09

This is the initial release of this module, the goal is to provide a set of tools for working with and developing Azure Devops Extensions as quickly and easily as possible. There are two Types that we work with Manifest and Task, each of these are used in developing the extension.

You can find the documentation for the Extension Manifest [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/develop/manifest?view=azure-devops#discoveryprops)

You can find the documentation for the Task Refernce [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-task-lib/blob/master/tasks.schema.json)

From there I built out an initial set of cmdlets based on what you would find in a typical vss-extension.json and task.json.
